Not every work that s/he can do.everyone has a phone nowdays so mobile application uses artificial intelligence to remember the key sound of the moment.that can help non hearing peoples.also an application is very optimized so it is usable in low battery of phones

Features :
 app can recognize a key sound event of interest,
 System have an alarm system to alert the user
The system is well optimized with low latency so it drains the low battery of the phones.

NFS : 
Latency of the app should be less than 2 seconds
